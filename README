# Automatized Quickplots for ECHAM6 output.

#
# This script processes your output data and, based in your inputs, generates
# job scripts for generating more diagnostic plots.
#
# It can manage several experiments at a time.
#
# Modify until before the job script writing.
# You can set the variables with relevant values for your case.
#
# But modify the code itself under your responsibility.
# First, understand the code or ask me. There are some advanced topics as
# pattern recognition with regex in grep or sed.
#
# For questions about the job script, ask Renate Brokopf. She is the expert. I
# only added an abstraction layer around the job script.
#
# Quickplot.job original file that I used as template can be found at:
#
# /pool/data/ECHAM6/post/QuickScripts/QuickPlot.job
#
# At the bottom of job script you can find information for further types than
# annual climatological quickplots. For that end, you will need to modify
# my code to calculate the corresponding climatologies. We can work on it
# together or you can add this functionality on your own way.
#
# You can run the written Quickplot.job by yourself or using the flag
# actplot with value 1. If this is the setting, then the script will run
# sequentially over the Quickplot.job files for each processed experiment. This
# is quick, compared to the processing part.
#
# Also, the calc flag allows you to toggle on/off the processing. If you
# toggle it off, then it will ignore the processing and generation of scripts,
# and will pass directly to the execution of them. Obviously, there will be a
# failure if the scripts are not yet written. If you toggle it off and the
# actplot flag is also set to 0, then the script will do nothing, except for a
# list of experiments.
#
# If you modified the code, please make clear that you modified it, what is the
# modification and include references to us... and, of course, add you as an
# author.
